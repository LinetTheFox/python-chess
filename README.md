# python-chess
Chess game written in Python

My last chess attempt turned out to be not so successful. I tried to consider all the downsides of my java chess and make something actually good. Current version comes with terminal interface - after implementing (at least bigger part of) chess logic i might as well make some sort of window interface.

# Running
After extracting the zip simply run 
```
python3 chess
```
